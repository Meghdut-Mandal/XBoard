Clipboard ðŸ“‹ on steroids âš¡!

Tl;DR
Basically you can Copy Paste across devices.

## Example Use case :
Let's assume Raj is giving an online exam, and the code editor has gone full screen. If he tries to switch windows the test will be invalidated. 
Kundra, one of his friend agreed to help him with the code. Using this tool Kundra can send code directly into Raj's clipboard remotely form his PC.
